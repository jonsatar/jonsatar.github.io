                  <h2>A Guiding Philosophy - The Scientific Method</h2>
                  <p>The <u>scientific method</u> makes no initial assumptions, only careful observations regarding natural phenomena.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>A <u>phenomenon</u> is a natural or artificial event, in the broadest of senses. For the purposes of this course, we will consider an event to be the biological entity, that has a momentary existence, much like any other event we observe.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>If there is a <u>pattern</u> in these observations, we may make generalizations in concise statements called natural laws, which are derived through this inductive process. 
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     That is to say, <u>inductive logical processes</u>, in a loose sense, involve making a generalization or conclusion from the set of data. 
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     The <u>natural laws</u> are often very simple verbal, or better yet, mathematical statements. They are well- established theories that have both explanatory and predictive powers as well. This is the ultimate goal of the scientific method. 
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Experimentation is a crucial component of verifying inductive reasoning. </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     We design our experiments as a means to test our intial notion, that is the <u>hypothesis</u>. Thereby, allowing for its acceptance or rejection without bias.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The scientific method, used in our study of biology, somewhat <u>contrasts</u> the deductive logical processes often encountered in more precise disciplines such as mathematics.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                  <u>Deductive logical processes </u>have certain conclusions that logically follow from established and known premises. 
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                  Let us begin by using the scientific method as a heuristic to begin understanding some of the early developments in biology, that lay the groundwork for the intensive discipline it is today.                      
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     In the investigation below, let us investigate, <u>does the presence of capsaicin in chilies deter some predators but not others? </u>
                  </p>

               <h2>Discussion</h2>
               <p>We conclude that our original hypothesis was correct and that it appears chillies are efffective in the deterrance of some preedators but not all. Can you design an experiment to test the hypothesis that the use of capsaicin in cooking is an adaptation resulting from its abiliity to kill disease causing bacteria? What laboratory apparatus could you use to design such an experment? We will investigate this further in the next lesson as a means to introduce some of the critical biological instrumentation.
